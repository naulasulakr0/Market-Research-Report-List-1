<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Recycling Sink Float Separation Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Spiral Separation Tank</li><li>Double Spiral Separation Tank</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic recycling sink-float separation tank market comprises two main types: single spiral separation tanks and double spiral separation tanks. Single spiral separation tanks utilize a single spiral mechanism to separate materials based on density, effectively allowing lighter plastics to float while heavier ones sink. In contrast, double spiral separation tanks employ dual spirals, enhancing separation efficiency and throughput by enabling two parallel flows. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing plastic recycling processes, leading to better material recovery and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
